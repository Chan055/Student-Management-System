# Students Management System

## Description

The Students Management System provides a platform for educational institutions to efficiently manage student data. It is built on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and interface-based design, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. The system utilizes file handling for persistence, ensuring data integrity between sessions.

## Functional Overview

1. **Show Student Details (Option 1):** Displays the details of all students in the system. If no students are present, it notifies the user.

2. **Add Student (Option 2):** Allows the user to add either an undergraduate or a graduate student by entering their details such as name, ID, and major/job. It includes input validation to ensure only valid data is entered.

3. **Save Student to File (Option 3):** Writes all current student details to a file named "Student.txt", ensuring data persistence.

4. **Delete Student (Option 4):** Provides the functionality to remove a student from the system based on their type (Undergraduate or Graduate) and ID. It includes checks to ensure the student exists before deletion.

5. **Search Student by Name (Option 5):** Searches for students based on a name input, useful for large databases where manual searching is inefficient.

6. **Exit (Option 6):** Terminates the program, providing a clean and controlled exit.
